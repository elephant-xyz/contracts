# Foundry Migration Summary

## What Was Done

Successfully implemented a hybrid Hardhat/Foundry setup for the vMahout project with automatic upgrade validation:

### Phase 1: Foundry Setup ✅

- Updated `foundry.toml` with proper configuration for hybrid setup
- Created symlinks from `src/` to `contracts/` for Foundry compatibility
- Installed OpenZeppelin Foundry Upgrades library
- Updated `.gitignore` to include Foundry artifacts

### Phase 2: Deployment Scripts ✅

- Created `script/Deploy.s.sol` for initial deployments
- Created `script/UpgradeVMahout.s.sol` for VMahout upgrades
- Created `script/UpgradeConsensus.s.sol` for PropertyDataConsensus upgrades
- All scripts use OpenZeppelin Foundry Upgrades for safety checks

### Phase 3: CI/CD Updates ✅

- Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to use Foundry for dry-run upgrades
- Updated `.github/workflows/release.yml` to use Foundry for production deployments
- Both workflows now use AWS KMS through Cast wallet

### Phase 4: Documentation ✅

- Updated `package.json` scripts to include Foundry commands
- Created comprehensive `README.md` with hybrid approach documentation
- Created `.env.example` template

### Phase 5: Automatic Upgrade Validation ✅

- Created `justfile` with automated build recipes
- Implemented automatic reference contract building:
  - Feature branches use `main` as reference
  - Main branch uses previous commit as reference
- Updated upgrade scripts to use reference builds
- Updated CI/CD workflows to build references automatically

## Key Benefits Achieved

1. **No Test Migration Required**: All existing Hardhat TypeScript tests continue to work
2. **AWS KMS Integration**: Secure deployments without exposing private keys
3. **OpenZeppelin Upgrades Safety**: Built-in validation for upgradeable contracts
4. **Better Gas Optimization**: Foundry's superior optimization capabilities
5. **Faster Compilation**: Foundry compiles significantly faster than Hardhat
6. **Automatic Storage Layout Validation**: Prevents accidental storage corruption during upgrades
7. **Branch-aware Reference Building**: Smart reference selection based on current branch

## Verification

- ✅ Foundry build successful: `forge build`
- ✅ All Hardhat tests passing: `npm test` (39 passing)
- ✅ Symlinks working correctly
- ✅ Dependencies installed properly

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. Test deployment scripts with a testnet
2. Verify AWS KMS access with `cast wallet address --aws`
3. Consider migrating some tests to Foundry for faster execution
4. Add Foundry-specific tests for gas optimization

## Important Notes

- The project maintains full backward compatibility with Hardhat
- All existing tests and tasks continue to work
- Foundry is only used for deployment and upgrades
- The hybrid approach allows gradual migration if desired
